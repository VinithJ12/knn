        "1. The main difference between regression and classification is that regression predicts continous numeric values while classification predicts discrete categories. Although both are a type of suprvised learning model, regression is centered around finding relationships between variables ( continous) while classification aims to categorize/ group inputs/ features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A confusion table ( aka confusion matrix) is a tool used in machine learning to assess the performance of classifications- by comparing known classifications w/ predicted ones. The matrix is a 2 x 2 table that tells us the :true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives. We'd like to see true positives and true negatives (highlights performance metrics)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. SSE ( Sum of Squared Errors) tells us how well the model fits the data ( we take the squared of the difference between the observed and predicted). Lower SSE tells us that there's little difference between observed and predicted.\n",

        "4. Overfitting is when the model is too specific to the traning data ( including complex/ highly specific)- but the model does poorly on test data ( the data that is unkown/ not seen before by the model). Underfitting is when the model is too simple/ general to the training data, it has too few parameters, and does poorly on both training and testing data\n",
        "\n",
        "5. We split data into training and testing because we would want to avoid overfitting. Majority of data should be training- developing general patterns with most of the dataset ( but not all)- overfitting if all data are training. We leave a small portion of data for testing ( to assess the performance of our model)-choosing k and performing SSE are important for model accuracy because the number of ks indicate how many groupings based on features the model should have ( shouldn't be too much)- overfitting- showing how every feature has it's own grouping. SSE is a metric for measureing how well the prediction is from the observed data.\n",

        "Yes, the KDE plots do look similar for the prediction and obseved. It looks like the curves and peaks are slightly off placed but the general pattern is present. The kNN model is doing a good job capturing the general trend in data. However, below the 60 mark in the review scores I can see small curves but don't see orange lines presents (underepresentation). The reason for the curve above could be due to number of reasons. Like since we only had 2 features to work with, we coul dbe having a loss information ( where having other key features would help with a diverse range of predictions). Also, the nature of kNN is that it predicts ratings based on the average of nearby points ( which explains why the model is not doing a good job in predcitng lower ratings)"
